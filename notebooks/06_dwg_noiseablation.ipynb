    "This notebook walks through extracting generated embeddings from noise ablation and calculating per-chip cosine similarity between the base embeddings and different types of ablation. These are then aggregated per class to quantify how sensitive the embeddings of each class are for each model to different bands. A KS test is applied to test whether ablated embeddings are significantly different from non-ablated embeddings."
